# Deep-Learning-with-Python-
Notes from "Practical Deep Learning from Visual Data" course will be here soon! 


In this lecture, Google Colab is preferred as the environment due to its ease to share your codes and assignments via Google drive. As Python package in Deep Learning, we are going to use PyTorch library very often. 


In terms of course structure: 

  First half: Introduction to Deep Learning
    * Fully-connected networks 
    * Deep learning frameworks (PyTorch)
    * How to train and debug neural networks
  
  Second half: Deep Learning from Visual Data
    * Convolutional neural networks
    * Deriving intelligence from image and video data
    * Deploying models
    
   
    
Stay tuned for the future notes!
